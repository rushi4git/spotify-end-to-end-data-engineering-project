# spotify-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
In this project, we build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the Spotify API and AWS services. The pipeline, written in Python, retrieves music and artist data from the Spotify API, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into an AWS data store for further analysis or reporting.
